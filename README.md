This is the contents of my src/ directory. If you wish to set this project up locally you will need to do a couple things:

```
1 - Create a new virtualenv with python 3 (IE virtualenv -p python3 junebug)
2 - mkdir src/ in your venv (IE junebug/src/)
3 - unzip the contents of "unzip-me-in-parent.tar.gz" into the directory above source (IE junebug/)
4 - install everything from requirements.txt
5 - python manage.py runserver
5b(optional) - do some finagle-ing with django to get the server actually working
